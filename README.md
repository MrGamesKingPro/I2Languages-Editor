    *   **Replace:** Replace a single instance of a term within the selected entry's text.
    *   **Replace All:** Globally replace all occurrences of a term across all entries for the selected language.
*   **TXT Export/Import:**
    *   **Export:** Save all translations for the current language to a simple `.txt` file for easy sharing or external editing.

#### **How to Use**

1.  **Run the Application:**
    ```sh
    python I2Languages-Editor.py
    ```

2.  **Open a File:**
    *   Go to `File > Open...` (`Ctrl+O`) and select your `I2Languages-resources.json` file.

3.  **Select a Language:**
    *   Once a file is loaded, the "Select Language" dropdown will be populated.
    *   Choose the language you wish to edit from the dropdown list. The table will update to show the translations for that language.

4.  **Editing Text:**
    *   The main table shows a single-line **preview** of each translation.
    *   **Click on a row** in the table that you want to edit.
    *   The full, original text (including line breaks) will appear in the **"Full Text Editor"** at the bottom.
    *   Make your changes in the text editor.
    *   Click the **"Save Changes"** button located next to the editor. This updates the text in the application's memory and refreshes the preview in the table. **This does not save the file to your disk.**

5.  **Searching and Replacing:**
    *   **Find:** Enter a term in the "Find" box and click "Find Next" to cycle through matches.
    *   **Replace Selected:** To replace text within a single entry, first select the entry in the table. Then, enter the text to find and the text to replace it with. Click "Replace". This will replace the *first* match within the text shown in the editor.
    *   **Replace All:** Enter the "Find" and "Replace" terms and click "Replace All". A confirmation will appear. This action will search and replace the term in **every entry** for the currently selected language.

6.  **Exporting and Importing:**
    *   **Export to TXT:** Go to `File > Export to TXT...`. This will save all translations for the currently selected language into a new text file, with each translation on a new line.
    *   **Import from TXT:** Go to `File > Import from TXT...`. Select a text file where each line corresponds to a translation. The tool will update the translations for the current language based on the contents of the file. You will be warned if the number of lines in the file does not match the number of terms.

7.  **Saving Your Work:**
    *   **Save (`Ctrl+S`):** Go to `File > Save` to overwrite the currently opened file with all your changes.
    *   **Save As... (`Ctrl+Shift+S`):** Go to `File > Save As...` to save your changes to a new JSON file.
