"The current number of memory channels being used and the maximum number available.

CPUs have a maximum number of memory channels. To use them you need to have enough separate sticks of RAM installed. "

The Base Clock is the heartbeat of the PC and dictates the speed of the other PC components. Adjusting this speed will affect the CPU and RAM speeds.

Note: Changing your Base Clock will disable the XMP RAM function."
"Current CPU speed ratio.

The CPU speed ratio is how much faster the CPU runs compared to the Base Clock.

Note: A CPU running faster could require more voltage to be stable and might need improved cooling."
"Current CPU voltage.

As a CPU runs faster it will need more voltage to remain stable. If your overclocked system crashes under load try increasing the voltage.

Warning: Too much voltage can damage a CPU and we recommend you don't go above 1.5v."
"Enable or disable XMP.

XMP (or Extreme Memory Profile) automatically overclocks your RAM to its rated stable speed and voltage. This is the easiest way to overclock your memory.

Note: Changing your Base Clock will disable XMP."
"Current RAM speed.

You can use this to manually overclock your RAM speed to any of the motherboard's presets.

Note: Increasing your RAM speed past its rated speed might require more voltage to remain stable."
"Current CPU speed.

The CPU speed is made up from the Base Clock multiplied by the Ratio.

Note: Increasing your CPU speed past its rated speed might require more voltage to remain stable and will likely need better cooling."

"Welcome to your new PC shop"
"Hey,

Thanks for taking over the PC shop for me, sorry it's not in a better state.

A few things:

- The company isn't doing very well and there is no money in the bank account

- The rent and energy bills come out monthly, so make sure you have enough money for them

- I had a job on the go which should help with the rent (see the email below) 

- Remember to use your thermal paste when putting in a CPU, I almost always forget, and the PC's overheat!

So, I think you're all set up! It's your company now so run it how you see fit, I hope you do better than I did.

Lots of love - Uncle Tim

P.S.
I had to borrow $15 for fuel, you know how it is"

"You won't believe what's happened!"
"Hello!
Last night I was at this bar, and I overheard someone talking about computers. Sounded like they were having some kind of technical issue, so I went over and introduced myself...
We get to talking and this lady says she manages some kind of 'e sports' team??? Apparently a bunch of kids play video games and get paid for it. Crazy, right?

Turns out they're running some pretty high-end hardware, and they're having reliability problems. Well, if anyone knows about reliability problems, it's me!
I told her about the company and my years of experience, and next thing I know I've landed a job as 'Technical Consultant'! That's right - I'm in the BIG LEAGUES now!
... Well, I think it's the big leagues. I'm not actually sure how the whole tournament thing works. But it's just video games - how complicated can it be?

Anyway, thought you might want to know. I might even be able to recommend you for some work if you're interested.

I'll be in touch,

I was building a PC earlier and I forgot which power supply to buy to support the 3080 I just added…

Have you been forgetting things? Needing somewhere to note what you were working on?

You could try Cloud Notes! It’s a great app where you can write notes for PC building and check them whenever you need to! It's pretty handy!

It should be with all your other apps, ready to install. Hope it’s helpful!

Uncle Tim

P.S. I’ve also given you access to a prototype I’m working on which will enable this app in your inventory too!"

"Hey,

Read an article online about business principles and it got me thinking: it's time I took Tim's Red Hot Repairs back to its roots.

Top priority? I set up a website. The article said you're nobody if you're not on the web!!! Take a look when you've got a minute:

>>>> www.TimsRedHotRepairs.com <<<<

Seriously, open up your browser and check it out! It's a real website! Took me HOURS to get it all working...

As for next steps, I've got my eye on a few local properties. (The money I'd need is tied up in that old workshop of yours, but I'm sure I can think of a quickfire way to get the cash...)

Anyway, just have a look at the website and let me know what you think. I'll keep you updated.

Excited for the future,
Uncle Tim

P.S. Do you keep anything flammable in the old workshop? And if not, do you think maybe you could start?

"How To Build a PC Mode"
"In this tutorial you will learn about the main components of a PC and how they go together."
"Open the Case"
"First, we need to remove the side panels of the case so we can install the components inside."
"Install the PSU"
"Great! Next up we'll install the Power Supply Unit (PSU), this provides the power to all of the components.

It lives behind a PSU mount which needs to be removed before the PSU can be installed."
"Install the Motherboard"
"At the heart of the PC is the Motherboard and all of the major components connect to it."
"Install the CPU"
"The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the PC's brain. It performs calculations based on information from some components and passes the results to others."
"Apply the Thermal Paste"
"The CPU gets very hot and it needs to be cooled by a Cooler.

First, we apply Thermal Paste to the CPU to improve the conductivity between it and the Cooler."
"Install the CPU Cooler"
"Now we can install the CPU Cooler.

There are two main cooling types: Air or Water."
"Install the Graphics Card"
"The next important component is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

GPUs are often mini-computers in themselves with their own processors and memory to calculate the complex visuals of todays games."
"Install the Memory"
"Next is the Memory, or RAM (Random Access Memory).

RAM is very fast memory that the CPU uses to hold the programs that are running on the PC. RAM comes in sticks and many of the same type can be combined to give the PC more memory to use."
"Install the Hard Drive"
"The last major component is the Hard Disk Drive (HDD).

The Hard Drive stores all the data for the Operating System, the Programs and the user's photos, music and videos."
"Additional Cooling"
"All the components of the PC give out heat.

Case Fans will help keep the temperature down by moving the hot air out of the case."
"Close the Case"
"Now we just need to replace all the covers to protect all those delicate components."
"Turn On PC"
"Now we need to plug in all the cables and power the PC on..."

"Mains Power"
"The PSU takes power from the wall socket. PSUs are rated from 200W to 1600W and you need to make sure you have enough wattage for your system."
"Modular Ports"
"These ports allow you to attach cables that carry power to the components. Modular means that you only have to attach the cables for the components you have."
"Fan"
"PSUs generate a lot of heat, this fan expels hot air."
"Front Case Side"
"Back Case Side"
"PSU Mount"
"Fan"
"The fan blows through the fins to move the hot air away from the heatsink."
"Heatsink Fins"
"The fins give a large surface area for the CPUs heat to be dissipated."
"Power"
"The fan needs power and this cable is plugged into a dedicated CPU fan socket on the Motherboard."
"Cooler Plate"
"This plate makes contact with the CPU (through the Thermal Paste) and is made from a highly heat-conductive material (usually copper)."
"Bracket"
"The bracket attaches the Cooler to the Motherboard; each CPU model has its own bracket size and shape."
"CPU Socket"
"This is where the CPU sits. It has a shield that holds it in place."
"RAM Slots"
"These are the slots where the system memory (RAM) goes. They will only allow one type of RAM and most Motherboards have between 2 and 8 slots."
"Power"
"Motherboards need enough power to run the components attached to them so they usually have more than one connector to the PSU."
"CMOS Battery"
"The CMOS Battery is used by the Motherboard to remember its settings when it has no power (even when not attached to a PSU)."
"Chipset"
"Chipsets are processors that support the CPU and manage how it works. Every CPU model has its own bespoke chipset that is designed to get the most from it."
"IO Ports"
"The Input/Output (or IO) ports are where you plug in all your peripherals like your keyboard and mouse."
"PCI Slots"
"The PCI slots are very high speed connections to the Motherboard for PCI Cards. The most common PCI cards are Graphics Cards but can also be WiFi or sound cards."
"HDD SATA Ports"
"These ports are called SATA (Serial ATA) ports and they are where the hard drives are connected."
"Front Panel Headers"
"This connector is where you attach all of the ports and buttons on your case to the Motherboard."
"Standoffs"
"Motherboards are screwed to the case using Standoffs which hold the Motherboard away from the metal of the case."
"Power Supply (PSU)"
"Motherboard"
"Processor (CPU)"
"Graphics Card (GPU)"
"System Memory (RAM)"
"Hard Drive (HDD)"
"CPU Cooler"
"PC Case"
"Heat Plate"
"The CPU has a heat plate that is attached directly to the Processor, this is designed to quickly get the CPUs heat away to the CPU Cooler."
"Pins"
"The CPU has pins that plug into the socket on the Motherboard. Each CPU model has its own pin layout and orientation in the socket."
"Processor"
"The Processor (or Die) is the chip that does all of the calculations in the computer. It is very delicate and is tightly packed so gets hot quickly."
"Fan and Heat Sink"
"The GPU gets hot and needs a large Heat Sink and Fan to keep it cool."
"PCI Connector"
"This connector fits into the PCI slot of the Motherboard and most Motherboards have a dedicated PCI slot just for GPUs."
"Back Plate"
"The backplate sits in the rear of the case and contains the connectors that go to your screen, like HDMI or DisplayPort."
"Dual GPUs"
"Many GPUs use this connector to allow for multiple cards to be linked together for more power - some systems allow up to 4 cards!"
"Graphics Processor"
"At the heart of the GPU is the Graphics Processor and it turns instructions from the CPU into something you can see on your screen."
"Connector"
"RAM connects to the Motherboard with a special connector. Each type of RAM has a special notch cut out to make sure that you don't put the wrong type together."
"Memory Chips"
"The chips on a stick of RAM are very fast types of memory designed to hold programs so the computer can access them as quickly as possible."
"Locks"
"Motherboard RAM slots have locking switches that grip the RAM here and hold it in place."
"SATA and Power"
"These connectors are used to connect the HDD to the Motherboard (SATA) and the Power Supply."
"Spinning Disc"
"A hard drive has a disc inside that spins, a bit like a DVD. The faster the disc spins the faster the data can be accessed, some server drives spin at over 15,000RPM!"
"Motor"
"Many Fans and Motherboards support variable speeds so the fan only runs as fast as it needs to."
"Fins"
"The fins control which way the air moves, look out for an arrow on the side of the fan to show which way the fan blows."

"Canst thou help?"
"Hail!

As thou art no doubt aware, the release of [CAN_PLAY] lies on the horizon. ‘Tis anticipated to be a most exciting game, with visceral recreation of marshal warfare, and the heart-rending tale of a peasantry struggling to break free of oppression. Truly, ye look’st upon a ‘game of the year’ candidate.

System requirements are as yet unknown for this ludoliterary tour-de-force but, as the bow is drawn in anticipation, still I must prepare myself for this imminent release.
I hereby commission thee in constructing for me a suitable ‘rig’. I will pay in gold or digital currency, as thou prefer.

Eagerly awaiting thy reply,
Kathren Breton
Assistant Guildmaster of the Ravagers"

"An upgrade, I beg of thee!"
"Greetings,

The computer thou built for me was a triumph! If thou couldst have seen the jealous countenances arrayed at my LARP group meeting when I told them of its power...

Alas, it was not to last. [CAN_PLAY] has been released (to much critical acclaim), but it runneth not as well as I had hoped. I have grass and shadow settings at medium, yet still I cannot reach 60 FPS during battle. They make a mockery of me in our LARP group chat!

I entreat thee: upgrade this computer so that I may see the glory of max settings, and show everyone that I am not simply a fool to be laughed at!

Anxiously awaiting thy reply,
Kathren Breton
Assistant Guildmaster of the Ravagers"
"axemaster93@ravagersLARP.com"
"Thy services are required again"
"Oh, woe! Tragedy has struck, and I know not what to do but to return to thee and place my fate in thy skilled hands.

I brought my newly-upgraded computer to yesterday’s LARP group event. I had intended to demonstrate its formidable capabilities, although it proved difficult to find a power socket. ‘Twas then that some churl questioned my commitment to historical accuracy!

In the ensuing melee, my computer sustained a mighty blow from a non-regulation wooden battle-axe. Since then, it no longer starts up. I must return to [CAN_PLAY] before my companions outlevel me! Canst thou make repairs?

Keenly awaiting thy reply,
Kathren Breton
Assistant Guildmaster of the Ravagers"

If not, I guess I can stretch to [SPEND_LESS_THAN] - just sold a goodie bag I nabbed from a recent event so got a bit extra floating around. Don’t forget the extra memory that I had last time! Might as well go up to 4 gigas - those pap photos are well big!

loved the rig u built. only thing is i wanted to try using it for streaming at the same time cause ive got like 1500 followers on my stream now and some of them are saying its a bit laggy

so i tried to overclock the cpu (otherwise i dont get 60fps ingame). found a guide online that seemed legit and i swear i followed it PERFECTLY. next thing i know theres smoke and the pc wont turn on anymore!!

mfw ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

i know its alot to ask but can u take a look and maybe replace the cpu if i broke it?

thanks"

cheers for the save on that cpu - cant believe i fried it. the overclock guide i was following mustve been wrong PJSalt PJSalt

anyway, remember before i was saying i wanted to get a dedicated streaming pc? had a bunch of people on my stream complain about low fps and i reckon this will sort it out. can u build something?

"Computer required for SCIENCE!"
"Hi,

I'm Giovanna Sciarra, a physicist embarking on a research project that - without wishing to exaggerate - looks set to REVOLUTIONISE the ENTIRE FIELD of theoretical physics. Naturally, I'm in need of a computer system to run the experiments, and I've heard you're reliable.

I'm on a tight budget (about [SPEND_LESS_THAN]), as this is currently a solo project, but I need something to control the specialised equipment I've ordered in from Switzerland.

Can you sort me out with something basic? A benchmark of [BENCHMARK_SCORE] will be plenty.

Thanks,

"SCIENCE is happening over here!"
"Hi,


Thanks for that computer - it works a treat!


My package from Switzerland finally arrived, and I spent several happy hours setting up my brand new Collide-O-Max 4500 particle accelerator. It's much the same as the Collide-O-Max 4000, but the sensitivity of the muon chambers has been improved, and it comes in a glossy red colour that really puts the 4000's dull grey to shame.


Naturally, there were some MINOR teething problems. When I initially warmed the system up, the magnetic coils attracted every metal object in the house. On the bright side, the several hours I spent extracting all the silverware from the walls was the perfect opportunity for me to go over the theory in my head.


I'm going to be spending the next day or two moving the equipment to the shed, where I'm less likely to be skewered by airborne cutlery.


I'll keep you updated.

"Hi,

It's Giovanna again. I'm making great progress - there'll be a breakthrough any day now, I'm SURE of it!

The only problem is that I've underestimated the processing power needed to run some of these calculations. The machine you built me handles the simple stuff okay, but it's really choking up on some of the more complex formulae I've developed. That's the price of PROGRESS, I suppose!

Could you upgrade the machine so it benchmarks something like [BENCHMARK_SCORE]? I recently got a small grant from my alma mater, so I'm good for the money.

Thanks a lot,

"More POWER needed"
"Hey,

Thank you for the upgrade. It's been ideal, and a great help as I build towards a better future for ALL of HUMANITY!

But to make a true breakthrough, I realise that I need a BIGGER particle accelerator. The Collide-O-Max 9850 would provide quite a step-up in power. I could finally be looking at piercing the space/time field. And to think - they said it couldn't be done in our lifetime! Why then, with the right combination of particulate matter and a carefully maintained field, I could-

... Well, that's not important right now.

If I'm going to work with a 9850, I'll need a second control computer to run in parallel. Could you build me something similar to the upgraded machine you did before? It was able to benchmark [BENCHMARK_SCORE], if you recall.

With these two machines, the onward march of SCIENCE is assured!

"Hi,


I've got the Collide-O-Max 9850 running in the shed now. It just about fits, although I had to cut out a large section of the east wall and route some power cabling through my neighbours tomato plants. Hopefully they won't notice - they still won't talk to me after what happened to their begonias last year.


Initial tests of the 9850 are promising, minus a few heat warnings. They're all well within acceptable limits, though. I'm sure it's fine.

"Well, it had to happen eventually.

I was running some new tests with my particle accelerator, and suffered a BAD magnet quench. It's kind of technical, but imagine superheated magnetic coils and you're not far off. I was lucky to escape alive. But nobody said REVOLUTIONISING the WORLD would be easy!

Sadly, the machine linked to it wasn't so lucky. Several components were exposed to some extraordinarily high temperatures, and now it will not turn on.

Can you replace whatever's broken and get it both back to me urgently? I need to get back up and running - SCIENCE waits for no one!

"Hi,


This might be quite a strange email, but we're getting desperate.


My dear sister, Giovanna, recently disappeared. When I searched her house, I found nothing except a bizarre-looking device in her garden shed, all wires and copper pipes. It was all black -- charred. And the smell... I think she was conducting some kind of experiment back there.


God knows I tried to warn her not to do it. She seeked answers to questions humanity is not supposed to ask.


Among the wreckage, I also found three computers (sadly all destroyed) and a shipping note with your details. It seems you were the last person Giovanna contacted before she vanished.


It's a long shot, but if you hear anything at all about where she might be, please let me know.

Of course, I do not blame you for any of this, as your work has been exemplary. But my son must be taught a lesson about lying to his father.

Just seen a mod that accurately models volumetric clouds down to the particle level, but looks like it needs one of those super-duper Tartan SLI graphics cards. Will get back to you once I’ve got the funds together!


~BTA, over and out!"
"CaptainBen@wingsofsteel.world"
"Mayday!"
"Mayday! Mayday! This is Captain Ben Arrow here, requesting urgent assistance!


So there I was, downloading new mods to take advantage of all that new hard drive space you added for me. There’s this one that physically models every metal panel on the plane, down to the torque on the individual screws! Talk about attention to detail!


Anyway, I downloaded it and then my computer started acting up! Some real digital turbulence going on here, you know? I imagine it’s a virus, although FreePlaneModzWorld seemed perfectly legitimate, with its multiple large flashing DOWNLOAD! buttons and all.


Anyway, I'm grounded until I can get this sorted out. Could you run a virus scan and remove anything you find? Thanks.


~BTA, over and out!"
"CaptainBen@wingsofsteel.world"
"Course correction!"
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! This is an announcement from the flight deck.


Just to let you know that we’ll be altering our course slightly - I won’t be buying that Tartan SLI card after all. I saved up the money, but decided to spend it instead on something more important - a honeymoon! 


That’s right - I proposed to my girlfriend, and she said yes!


Maybe in the future I’ll have enough cash again to jettison on a new graphics card but, for now, I’m focusing on the important stuff: co-navigating the turbulence of life with the best co-pilot I could ever imagine.


This is Captain Ben Arrow, signing off for now.

Did you get my memo saying thanks for the PC? PA is out of action for weeks so the intern's filling her shoes, and the on-boarding process has been a little... rocky.

Speaking of, hit a bit of a rough patch. Intern, in his infinite wisdom, spilled coffee all over the machine and shorted the motherboard. Could you replace for me? Just MB is fine. Can we get it done for a ballpark figure of [SPEND_LESS_THAN]?
If this goes well, there might be more work for you in the future - let's circle round and touch base once we've put this to bed.

Thanks for the new PC. It works alright, but I was hoping for higher FPS. It needs a faster graphics card. Can you handle that?

I know I said I needed to get on with my school work, but if you think about it a faster processor will totally help with that too. And hey, don't worry about my degree - this'll be the last upgrade before I really get my head down and get to work.

Besides, I'm still looking into that legal case with the stolen goods. There's this ruling from the 1800s that says it's illegal to openly carry fresh fruit in the summer months in the Upper Oxnard area. So... BAM! Got the sucker - he's guilty after all!

Saw some previews for the new Distant Call and... you should avoid it. I already cancelled my preorder. That's the last time I get played like a sucker by marketing, seriously. How do they get away with this stuff?

Oh! And remember that legal case with the stolen goods and the fruit and all? Well I checked with my tutor and apparently I've been reading the wrong case this whole time.

Not that I'm gonna find out, since I won't be playing it. Saw one of the devs on social media say that some of the features they promised won't make it into the final release.


Like, come on. Is it too much to ask for people to stick to the things they say they're gonna do?


Anyway, I guess I can use this new PC to catch up on my school work. I'm kinda behind at the moment, so I need to concentrate on my studies or I'll never graduate. I'm gonna be a judge some day!


Thanks for everything,

"Alternate repair'' service??"
"Hello,

I'm having problems with my computer. As I use it to organise meetings for my local Woodsie Alliance group and to share my thoughts on Rollr, it is very important that it be returned to working order.

However, as a great believer in natural healing processes and the power of positive energy, I would first like you to conduct an ''alternate repair'' session.

This requires you to dim the lights in your workshop, light some candles, and fully relax. You don't have to wear clothes if you don't want to.

As you relax, focus your thoughts on my computer and channel your energy flow to unmask and repair any damaged components. The following mantra may help to guide you:

Ra Pa Ma Co Pu Tah

Best wishes,
Hazel"
"hazel_leaf95@gaiaworld.com"
"Hands-on natural repair session required"
"Hello,


Just writing to say that the alternate repair session had no effect. It's most likely that you conducted the healing ritual incorrectly, but that's okay - you are a novice, after all.


Instead, I'll send my computer in to your workshop so you can work on it by hand - on the condition that you conduct the appropriate rituals to ensure that any physical changes don't affect the positive energy of the machine as a whole.


The rituals can be conducted as before, but with the following additions to hopefully make it more effective for a beginner such as yourself:


Healing crystals should be arranged around the machine to create an energy grid. This should really help in manifesting your goals and intentions. If you don't have a crystal merchant nearby, you may have to get creative. Wristwatches and many electronic components contain crystals, so these will do in a pinch.


An additional mantra to be used: Ma Dam Pi Si Wun Go. But take care, as this is a mantra of great power. Be particularly wary of the final syllable - pronounced incorrectly, this is a cure for baldness.


However many candles you set up last time, double it. You can never have too many candles. Do have a fire extinguisher on standby, though. We don't want a repeat of the Fellwood incident.


Best wishes,

Hazel"

"Bad energy??"
"Hello again,

Thank you for attempting to repair my computer. However, on receiving it I've noticed that it still doesn't turn on. Needless to say, I am disappointed that I have to teach a so called ''expert'' how to fix a computer.

One of my friends at the Woodsie Alliance tells me there may be a malevolent spirit to blame, and I'm inclined to believe them. Could you check the system over for any malicious energies and purge them?

I didn't get all the details, but my friends suggested method includes:

Lubricate all components with a highly-diluted solution of thermal paste. This has the effect of triggering the computer's own cooling mechanisms, which may aid recovery from any malware infection.

Burn the thigh bone of a blessed sheep in the presence of the computer to drive out the evil spirits. If you cannot easily obtain an ethically-sourced sheep bone, a chicken drumstick will do.

Place round magnets at the energy points on your forehead and your upper chest. They can be held in place with sticky tape. IMPORTANT: Do NOT get too close to the computer while conducting the ritual, or the magnetic essence will blank the hard drive.

Best wishes,
Hazel"

"Computer in need of an 'upgrade'"
"Good day,


I am Bruce van Cleefe (award-winning author), and I have recently found myself in need of your services.


Personally, I cannot stand modern technology and prefer to work on my trusty 1957 Quiet-Typer. Unfortunately, my editor is insisting that I transfer the latest draft of my current novel - the next great novel of this century - into a digital copy for his convenience.


Convenience... How I detest that word. Is there anything more sickening than taking the raw, hard-won outpourings of a writer - his very heart and soul rendered in ink upon a page - and converting it into a digital document? Reducing it to nothing more than bits and bytes to be shuffled between computers like so many spreadsheets?


Anyway, my current computer is an outdated hulk I purchased several years ago, and it seems it's not able to run the latest professional writing software ('Scribener') with quite enough vim. Kindly upgrade the machine so that I can continue my work. The future of literature depends upon it.


Best regards,

"Low disk space? I despair!"
"Good day,


I knew all of this technology was a terrible idea. It was doomed from the outset, and I've had to sit by as the whole technological farce tumbles down around me.


You'd think electronics these days would be able to handle a simple 500-page novel, but apparently it's simply too much to ask. First my keyboard gave up the ghost, and now I'm being told that I'm running low on disk space.


Whatever happened to the days of just writing directly onto paper and submitting a finished draft by hand? Naturally, one first had to build a small outbuilding in which to properly store one's paper. My father's was cedar, but any hardwood will do in a pinch. The really important part is choosing the location: good drainage and proximity to the house are both of paramount importance, as is avoiding any obviously uneven terrain. It's all worth it, of course, because after the proper storage is arranged one can move on to the exciting task of collecting writing paper.


But, I digress.


I gather it's a fairly simple fix to add more disk space, but naturally I'm loathe to attempt it myself. Would you be so kind as to do whatever is necessary?

"Technology - the bane of my life"
"Good day,


Predictably, my computer has failed once more. This time the thing won't turn on at all. Goodness only knows why. I can only assume it died out of desperation.


I'm an award-winning author, you know - I should not have to deal with this sort of thing. I certainly never had any of these problems with my typewriter. The only problems I had with that were changing the ink ribbon once in a while and having to hear my editor whine about dealing with real paper for a change.


That's the problem with people these days: no literary constitution.


Anyway, do what you can. I just want this techno-dystopian nightmare to end.

"Foiled once again"
"Just when you thought the technological fates could not be any more cruel, they have delivered the ultimate blow. I will make sure that my editor hears no end of all this, since the whole blasted debacle was his idea in the first place.


Anyway, I was within a gnat's whisker of having my entire draft finally converted into a document, when disaster struck. The computer completely froze. When I try to use it, it says system disk error.


There was a mere handful of pages left to convert. Please, I implore you - fix this so I can finally be done with this editing process and move on with my life.

"I am over the cliff-edge. Hanging for dear life above the abyss of despair as the world hurls stones and treads on my fingers.


Yes, I am doomed. And, by extension, literature is doomed with me.


My work was stored on the computer's hard drive - countless hours of torturous banality, feeding my life's work into this unfeeling machine. And all for nought? The hard drive failed and you replaced it with another. Ergo, all that was... is lost.


Fear not: I do not blame you. I blame my editor for proposing this Sisyphean task in the first place.


But I will require your services once more. In my anguish, I delivered a terrific thrashing unto this demoniac machine which has cost me my time, my patience, and - I fear - my sanity.


Needless to say, it no longer turns on - this is fine by me, but my editor is becoming intolerably anxious, so I'd like you to fix it if for nothing else than to keep him quiet.

It seems my publisher is unwilling to offer a second advance on my current work in progress, leaving me utterly destitute and unable to afford the endless stream of electronic nonsense I've been forced to purchase just to keep my editor happy.


Well, I won't stand for it! I am an award-winning author, after all. So I have decided to sell this computer - this electronic laughing-stock; this pox on literature - and slink back to my typewriter in the hope of rediscovering my muse. I only hope it's not too late.

"FWD: Van Cleefe Does It Again"
"Just forwarding part of this magnificent article about yours truly from the Metropolitan Literary Express:


> [...] but what really surprises us about Van Cleefe is that he continues working at all.

> Here is a man of such bizarre 'talent' that it's a wonder he hasn't yet been taken away by the aliens who, we presume, dropped him off in the first place.

> Instead, he consents to stay with the rest of us mere mortals, plugging away tirelessly at a book which is due to come out several years late and full of prose so incomprehensible to the common reader that it's hard to believe a human had any hand in its creation at all.


Isn't it marvellous? I've always thought of myself as an author who transcends base literature, but to have it confirmed by the MLE is a real feather in my cap.

"I'm Blake Patterberg, and I'm one of the core team over at MovieManiax, the world's #53 website in the UK for movie news and reviews.


With the upcoming release of the next highly-anticipated blockbuster in the Frondbuster Cinematic Universe (FCU), I'm trying to refresh my memory of the previous films -- Frondbuster, Frondbuster 2, Frondbuster III: Frondamania!, Frondbuster 4: Frondly Remembered, and the much-maligned spin-off Archie Bald and the Spinning Cups - A Frondbuster Story.


I already own all the collector's editions on blu ray, but I'd like to rip them to my computer for a more complete, frame-by-frame analysis. Sadly, I don't currently have enough hard drive space to do so.

"15 years of Bathimoor Babes!!"
"Hey,


As you're no doubt aware, it's nearly the 15th anniversary of beloved cult classic Babes of Planet Bathimoor. You would think the Powers That Be would've used the opportunity to release a 4K remaster, but no. They haven't even reissued the old DVD, which now commands a high price at auction online. It's like they don't WANT money!


Not that the old DVD is any good, by the way. The film transfer is super noisy compared to the much superior LaserDisc home release, and they completely ruined the iconic underwater dance number with stupid-looking CGI fish.


I wanted to host a viewing for my friends, but my own LaserDisc was sadly destroyed when a pile of imported Japanese horror film steelbooks fell on it, so I was forced to use 'less legal means' to get a copy in time for the day itself.


Now I'm no stranger to venturing into the darker side of the internet if necessary, and it's perfectly safe if you know what you're doing. After all, just like Captain Cartwright said in the film: 'We explore planet Bathimoor not because we are merely curious, but because we must see what lies beyond!'


(And what a great character, am I right? I'll never understand how he didn't clinch the top spot in MovieManiax's Top 100 Proselytizing Protagonists list.)

"Hey there,


Bit of a crisis here.


I'm supposed to be helping out on an article for MovieManiax - a series retrospective of the Sonic Munk trilogy. This series is MASSIVE (in some indie film circles in Denmark), so you can understand why I want to take the utmost care to get this right.


The last thing I need is another mob of angry film fanatics flaming me on the message boards and leaving snarky comments on every article.


As usual, I ripped my blu rays to my computer so I can do more a detailed analysis of the frame image. But then the hard drive they were on made this loud 'clunk' sort of sound and I can't access any of the files!


Can you do something? I need to get this article written, or all the Sonic Munk fans - and there are nearly twenty of them!! - are going to be VERY disappointed.

Thanks for the help with that hard drive before - my Sonic Munk article went down a treat!

Would you believe, I'm still struggling to find a replacement copy of Babes of Planet Bathimoor! The best I've come across so far was a bootleg DVD of the theatrical cut, but the colour reproduction on the naked buffet scene was just awful, and the screen went all wobbly during Captain Cartwright's rousing speech to the downtrodden underclasses.

I've been checking online auctions every day for months, but I can't find a genuine, unsullied LaserDisc version - what if this landmark film is lost forever?!

But if I were to start my own cult classics archive...? I need to give this some thought.

Thanks to the... TIRELESS work of the Federation's computer expert, a force-field around Placidius has been established, and the planet was safe when the... STAR went SUPERNOVA. Sadly, the... artificial satellite in orbit was... completely destroyed... I regret that we were not able to study it in more detail to... determine its... MYSTERIOUS origins.



After the full FORCE of the cataclysm has passed, Placidius will... continue to turn in the... pale light of its new dwarf star. But its people will be faced with a new challenge...



With the satellite no longer absorbing all negative emotions on the planet's surface, the... Placidians must, for the first time in their lives, become acquainted... with their darker side. The 'Planet of Peace' is no more. And so the... REAL work of a civilisation in its moment of rebirth... must begin.



As we return to Human Federation space, things aboard are returning to normal. The crew are feeling more at ease... with every passing hour... But we've all learned just how... QUICKLY... friends can turn against each other in the heat of the moment.



I only hope the... Placidians can learn the same lesson... without bloodshed.

"By Royal Appointment"
"As your Queen, it's my duty to take an interest in all things important to my people.

One is informed by the royal staff that PC gaming is becoming an increasingly popular pastime, and so it is one's royal duty to properly acquaint oneself.

For the best experience, one apparently requires a 'monster rig'. Kindly build one that's up to royal standards, and the Royal Warrant will be granted to your business.

A 'benchmark' of [BENCHMARK_SCORE] will be satisfactory. One would also very much like to see the finished piece adorned with suitably royal purple lighting.

HRH The Queen"
"maj@hrh.royals.org"
"Royal repairs required"
"Your previous work on building a computer by royal appointment was most satisfactory. One has an obligation to experiment with this 'PC gaming', and it seems there are certainly a great many games which one can download to be played.

However, having just started enjoying the likes of Feudal Fantasy and WrestleMad XIV, one was most upset this morning to find that the corgis had mangled several components and chewed through a number of important-looking cables.

These things happen, but it would be most appreciated if you could conduct the necessary repairs post-haste so one can return to one's gaming.

HRH The Queen

P.S. The paperwork for your Royal Warrant will be submitted as soon as possible after repairs are conducted."
"maj@hrh.royals.org"
"Many royal thanks"
"One is greatly enjoying the use of this gaming PC - particularly the online multi-player games available.

At first they seemed frightfully violent, but one must say that the first time one 'pwned' another player was quite the delight! One almost doesn't want to stop once one is on a winning streak.

Do you play any of these multi-player games over the internet? If so, hit one up in-game: -HRH-19DaQueen55 - but be prepared to be 'wrecked'.

HRH The Queen"
"maj@hrh.royals.org"
"Further royal repairs needed"
"One hates to be the bearer of bad news, but one's rig is once again in need of repair.



But it wasn't the corgis this time: a lady-in-waiting spilled a full pot of tea over the machine while one was using it! It almost seemed deliberate, but one can't imagine why...



Although it's true that it's becoming quite difficult to tear oneself away from the games, and one's official engagements are beginning to suffer somewhat.



Only the other day there was a missed meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister. But you must understand: one was top of the leaderboard! One cannot allow scrubs and noobs free reign over one's server without retaliation.



Anyway, kindly make the necessary repairs - one would very much like to get back in game.

"A royal robbery"
"Outrage! Scandal! Treason!

The palace is in uproar today, and for good reason. One's royal rig has been stolen!

As to the culprit, one cannot make any outright accusations, but one has heard an increasing chorus of complaints from palace staff about one's playing video games instead of attending to royal duties.

Still, life must go on, and one would like a replacement. Something that can reach a benchmark of [BENCHMARK_SCORE] would be suitable. And please install two graphics cards. One may as well take advantage of the situation to get an upgrade, after all. And lots of purple.

HRH The Queen"
"maj@hrh.royals.org"
"The Queen is stepping down..."
"One must announce, with a heavy heart, that one is throwing in the towel and retiring... from multi-player gaming.



Upon the arrival of one's spectacular new gaming PC (a truly magnificent machine), one's retinue seemed immediately dissatisfied. Scarcely a day later, one was sat down by one's staff and given a stern talking-to about the importance of the royal duties.



It should be noted that one does not usually suffer being given a talking-to about anything, least of all the royal duties which one has performed since before many of one's staff were in their nappies! But one must occasionally allow it, as ignoring such issues can lead to one's staff getting all uppity, and then before one knows it someone has leaked something awful to the press.



Anyway, it has been made clear that multi-player online gaming, while popular among the people, has no place in one's daily life (even if one is terribly good at it). Important work was being left undone, and diplomatic relations were at risk (the Dutch Prime Minister is still most upset).



One must regretfully inform you that, as this entire episode might be seen in a negative light by certain media outlets, the palace has declined to approve your Royal Warrant. However, one will never forget all of the good work you have done.



You have the personal thanks of Her Majesty.

"The Upgrade"
"It was cold and windy that day, as if the Mother Nature herself was giving the whole city the finger. Scowling, I took a sip from my glass as I stared out of the window. I hated whisky.

That's when she walked in. A tall blonde in a thick wool coat. She'd been crying. Right away I knew it was going to be a hell of a day.

She said her name was Sam, and she was a pro gamer. The dark folds of her overcoat concealed a mechanical keyboard, so I knew she was legit. She handed over a black box - a gaming rig - and told me she wanted upgrades.

I asked her why she would come to me - a regular private detective - just for an upgrade job. It didn't make sense. That was when she got so close I could smell her perfume.

She was in with some powerful people, and she was scared, she said. She knew too much and her PC was a target. But she still wanted it to be upgraded. It had to be the best. She might've been beautiful on the outside, but in her heart she was just another burned out gamer, chasing raw performance at any cost.

I grimaced as I drained my glass. Why did I keep drinking this stuff?

To this day I'll never know exactly why I agreed to the job. Maybe it was her doe-eyed look of desperation. Maybe it was the whisky going to my head. Maybe it was the Final Warning letter from the bank burning a hole in my desk drawer.

At the time, it seemed like a simple enough job. Just upgrade the rig with a second GPU  and we should be able to hit a benchmark of [BENCHMARK_SCORE]+? Piece of cake.

Of course, nothing is ever as easy as it seems...

"The Dead Case"
"The rain came down in sheets as I hauled the metal case up and out of the rushing river. It was riddled with holes, and brown water tumbled out in bubbling cascades.



I sighed. It was definitely Sam's gaming rig. Going by the holes, I reckoned it'd been shot, stabbed with a small blade, shot again, and then dumped in the river.



One thing was for sure: this was no accident.



I figured there might still be some evidence on the hard drive, but without the rest of the computer it was about as useful as a feather duster in a gunfight. If I was gonna get to the bottom of this, I was gonna have to send the whole machine off for repairs...

"The Incognito Rig"
"By now it was pretty clear that Sam was right - her computer had been in danger. I was just too much of a fool to see it until it was too late. Now she was gone. Or she wouldn't return my calls, at any rate.



She was just a memory now... but I'd cashed the cheque she gave me as an advance that morning, so I figured I should investigate what went wrong. I owed her that much.



Her computer had taken a few bullets, but with the help of an expert I managed to get the hard drive running again. This case was tougher than I thought.



Just as I'd hoped, the goons that did the hit job had left a trail of evidence. I followed the lead and ended up with the details of a strictly private LAN party downtown. If I wanted to find out who trashed Sam's PC - and why - I was gonna have to get in there and snoop around.



But if I wanted to get into a private LAN party, I was gonna need a gaming rig of my own - one those goons wouldn't recognise...

"The LAN Party Scuffle"
"The LAN party was almost a total bust... Almost.



I got in okay, thanks to the slick-looking rig I was carrying, but it didn't take the goons inside long to blow my cover. I'm no pro gamer, so I stuck out like a sausage in a pork pie.



Maybe it was the sweat dripping down my forehead, or maybe it was the fact that I lost seventeen straight matches of League of Lore, but after a couple of hours I felt this big hand come down on my shoulder, and I knew the jig was up.



It's safe to say I won't be welcome back at the LAN party any time soon, but I got what I came for: a look at the guy in charge.



I saw him watching as I was getting dragged out the door. Big guy, with snow white hair and a crimson scar down one cheek. I still need to find out who he is, but a face like that can't be too hard to track down...

Steve Shovel, P.I."

"LeDraw"
"It took a long time to track down the guy with the white hair and the scar.



Days turned to long nights, trawling through search results and drinking lukewarm coffee. It became an obsession. He was the white whale, and Ahab was closing in. The night I finally found him, I was in the mood for celebration and I broke out the whisky. Then I remembered why I'd stopped drinking it in the first place. Where had my uncle even got this stuff? It tasted like petrol.



Anyway, the guy's name was LeDraw. He was some collectible card game hotshot - had a few high-profile wins and was tipped to be the next big thing. Then he had a meltdown on a stream. Went off on some tirade about 'normies' and banned half his moderators. That was pretty much the last anyone ever heard of him...



Until now.



But what brought him out of hiding? Could it be the Big Tournament being held in the city this year? It was due to start soon, and there was some major cash to be won. But LeDraw has gotta be out of practice after all this time - he wouldn't stand a chance, unless...



There was still more dirt to dig up, but I was starting to get closer to the truth. I was backing up everything I found, just to be safe. The only problem was my computer was running out of hard drive space to store it all.



I saved what I could and sent the PC off for a storage upgrade. I was gonna find out what LeDraw was up to, no matter what it cost...

Steve Shovel, P.I."
"steve.shovel@theprivateeyes.com"
"The Warning"
"With the additional storage space, I had no problems tracking down everything I needed to know about LeDraw and his operation.



There was a trail of messages between him and a dozen other CCG nuts - tournament players, streamers, hardcore fans... There was a lot missing, or that I couldn't access, but a picture was beginning to form.



LeDraw and his cronies were planning to rig the Big Tournament, and take home the grand prize for themselves!



It was gonna be up to me to stop them. After all, if there's one thing I can't stand, it's a cheater. There was just one little problem...



LeDraw and his goons acted quickly when Sam came to me asking for an upgrade. She must've been getting too close to the truth. And now that I was neck-deep in their business, I knew it was only a matter of time before they got to me, too.



It was three in the morning when they kicked in my door. I sat bolt upright and tried to act like I was still working hard, in case it was a client with a paycheck. Then I changed my mind and tried to act like I hadn't worked in months, in case it was about my unpaid taxes.



As it turned out, maybe the tax man wouldn't have been so bad. At least they don't usually carry baseball bats.



I got out with a few bruises and a broken nose, but the damage to my PC was pretty bad. I just hoped I could get it repaired in time to figure out a way of stopping LeDraw...

"The Law"
"After the beating my rig got from LeDraw's thugs, I was surprised to find any evidence left that could be recovered, but I got lucky I guess.



Not lucky enough to avoid taking a beating myself, of course, but life as a P.I. teaches you to look for the little victories. Lady Luck had given me a break. Now I just had to work out what to do with it.



So I took everything I had to the cops. I figured it was worth a try, right?



Wrong. I got fobbed off with excuses and shuffled back out the door quicker than you can say 'waste of police time'. I even tried bribing them with the bottle of whisky from my desk, but it was no-go. I just can't get rid of that stuff. When did they start hiring honest cops in this town, anyway?



But I couldn't just stand by and let LeDraw carry out his scheme. The integrity of the ﺔﻴﻧﻭﺮﺘﻜﻟﻹﺍ ﺕﺎﺿﺎﻳﺮﻟﺍ scene depended on someone drawing a line in the sand... and I guess that was up to me now.



Besides, how else was I gonna get paid for all this?

"LeDraw's plan to hijack the Big Tournament was already underway, and I had to stop him somehow. But with the cops leaving me hung out to dry, I was on my own again.

No sweat. I work better that way.

My plan was simple. Enter the Big Tournament myself, reach the grand final, and beat LeDraw at his own game. Easy as pie, right?

First things first, I was gonna need to get some practice in at the games they'd be playing at the Big Tournament. My PC wasn't gonna be up to the task, so I sent it off for a quick upgrade. Not a problem, I figured. With the tournament prize money, it'd practically pay for itself.

Right - time to make me a Kingpin, or maybe even a double Kingpin...

"The Party"
"I don't know if it was the great PC I had, or the light-headedness from having to carry it all the way across town to the venue, but I went into the Big Tournament feeling like I actually had a chance at this thing.



And what do you know? For once, I was right. Sure, it was tough-going for the first few games, but once I got into the swing of things I shot up through the qualifiers in no time, then the quarter-finals the next day, and then the semis. I felt like I was unstoppable - like I was some kind of gaming god. The screaming fans certainly helped.



And maybe it was because I was on a mission of sorts, but I felt like fate was on my side. Like Lady Luck was right there with me, laser-focused on taking down LeDraw.



Yes, it was going swell, and I went out drinking with Phase3 - an ﺔﻴﻧﻭﺮﺘﻜﻟﻹﺍ ﺕﺎﺿﺎﻳﺮﻟﺍ team that had also just got through to the semis. I liked them; they were good people. First, because they kept buying me drinks. Second, because they accepted my gift: that bottle of whisky the cops wouldn't take. Yes, I finally got rid of the goddamn thing.



We really painted the town red - and why not? I was on top of my game, and LeDraw was in my sights. His little cabal had been making their way up the league tables too, sure, but I figured I could take them. I'd beaten everyone else, after all.



I passed out on a park bench that night and slept like a log, dreaming of video games and victory. But I was gonna have a nasty surprise waiting for me when I woke up, and it wasn't just the hangover...

"The Cruel Dawn"
"I woke up with one hell of a hangover.



It felt like I'd been hit by a freight train, and my head was swimming so fast I could barely tell which way was up. Trying to stand, I just rolled off the park bench and hit the concrete. At least now I knew which way was down.



Stumbling between sturdy objects and the occasional unwilling pedestrian, it took me over an hour to walk the two blocks back to my office. It took everything I had to turn the handle, then I fell through the door and lay sprawled out and groaning on the hardwood for a while.



It was deceptively comfortable, but I couldn't just stay there all day - I had work to do.



I got up and staggered towards the bathroom, leaning against the desk for support and almost tripping over the computer on the floor. My feet didn't feel like following orders that morning, and I was in no condition to take charge of the situation. I shuffled past, trying not to step on all the broken pieces of plastic. I twisted the cold tap and dunked my head under the stream for a second. Then I came back up, dripping wet and gasping. It was cold as hell.



Wait a second - what was my rig doing on the floor?



I ran back to the heap of electronics and tried to make sense of what I was seeing. It was a complete mess. Someone had gotten into the office while I was out drinking, and they'd torn my computer apart. And I bet I knew who ordered them to do it. LeDraw...



I did my best to put it all back together, but it was all covered in dust and I couldn't find most of the memory sticks. When it booted up, I was greeted with a laughing sound and a black wallpaper that simply said: 'GIVE UP'. Those thugs must've installed a virus, too. This was a new low.



I grabbed some packing tape and prepared to send the computer off, express. I needed it back in action by the next day, or I was out of the tournament...

"With my PC repaired and in good shape, I breezed through the semi-finals. I even saw a couple of LeDraw's cronies get knocked out of the tournament. He was running out of allies.

Now it was the eve of the finals. It all came down to this.

I saw LeDraw that day. I don't know if he recognised me from the LAN party I got booted out of - it seems like that was an eternity ago. I shook his hand and said I looked forward to facing him in the final.

He didn't look so tough, up close. In fact, he almost looked scared.

When I got back to my room, there was a package waiting for me. It was from Sam, the dame who first got me tangled up in all this.

I tore open the box, and found a slip of paper. On it was just two words in tall, elegant handwriting: 'Use this'. Underneath was a smooth, black and red metal case. It was her old rig - the one I saved from the river.

It needed a new CPU, and I was going to get the latest and greatest processor I could.

"The Final Match"
"When the sun rose that morning it felt like any other day - but by the time it set, I would be a different man.

I took Sam's computer over to the ﺔﻴﻧﻭﺮﺘﻜﻟﻹﺍ ﺕﺎﺿﺎﻳﺮﻟﺍ arena with my hard disk nestled in the drive bay. LeDraw was there already, hooking up his rig. It was a beast of a machine - all shining chrome, with a slash of red neon down one side that echoed the scar on its owner's cheek. He glared at me over his monitor. He wanted to be playing against one of his pals - someone who would throw the game. Instead, he got me.

I've gotta give the guy some credit - he put up one hell of a fight. For the first half of the match, it was everything I could do just to stay in the game. He seemed to be one step ahead of me the whole way. I figured, that was it - I was done. After everything I'd gone through, I was about five minutes away from just standing up and conceding.

But then I looked at the computer on my desk - Sam's computer - and something just... clicked.

Next thing I knew I was making the greatest comeback since Elvis. The crowd was on my side, and I had him on the ropes. I chanced a look over my screen... he looked peeved. More than usual, I mean.

I don't recall too much after that. The cheers, I remember. Bright lights. Someone shoved a trophy into my hands. Then I was adrift in the crowd. Back up on the stage, LeDraw faded into the background and disappeared - he was finished. A week later I would release all the info I had on him and his cronies, and he got served a lifetime ban from competitive play. To be honest, I'm not sure it was necessary. He wasn't coming back. He didn't have the guts.

I was back in my office when Sam came by to collect her computer, and to say thanks. With LeDraw gone, she finally felt safe. After everything that happened, I can't say I blame her.

Before she left, she leaned in and said she had a surprise for me. I swallowed, hard. She reached inside that big coat of hers. I couldn't believe my luck.

Then she pulled out a new bottle of whisky...

Yesterday, I received intelligence that enemies from Sector 81 were planning to attack one of our power and lighting sub-junctions, causing random blackouts across the sector. But what they cannot see, they cannot attack. Therefore, as a preventative measure, I have disabled power and lights in that area.

Due to an unexpected oversupply of nuclear waste to the Sector 72 cafeteria, the Worker Food Supply Terminal has ceased to function.



This is not currently a problem, as all workers in the area who would need food supplied to them have also ceased to function due to the oversupply of nuclear waste. However, the Hazard Cleanup Crew and replacement workforce are en route, and will require food.

"--TOP SECRET-- Service Delays"
"Dear loyal citizen,

Once again, Sector 72 is in need of your skills.

Enemy activity has temporarily taken some of the sector's parallel processing units offline. Out of --REDACTED-- total units, there is currently a total of one still functional.

This loss of processing power is having a deleterious effect to systems across the sector, such as automatic doors opening too late (resulting in workers being unacceptably delayed) or closing too soon (resulting in workers being unacceptably terminated).

Other systems are also affected. In the food area, the Worker Food Supply Terminal experienced high latency while dispensing a jumbo-sized strawberry milkshake. To compensate for the several seconds of delay, it dispensed the entire amount in one blast. This resulted in rapid disassembly of the worker and a stage 4 biohazard in cafeteria 3.

While we work to restore the damaged processing units, you must upgrade the remaining unit to minimise disruption. A benchmark score of [BENCHMARK_SCORE] will be satisfactory.

NOTE: A benchmark score of less than [BENCHMARK_SCORE] will be unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance is grounds for termination.

"Hi,

I'm Martine Ventrix, entrepreneur and director of SubWorks GmbH.

SubWorks, as you may have heard from our press release last month, is a privately-funded deep-sea exploration venture. I founded the company to embark on an exciting voyage of discovery, where every day presents new opportunities to learn more about the world around us.

The Neptune Mark I will be a comprehensively equipped deep-sea submersible, with a crew complement of twelve and the ability to stay underwater for up to six months at a time. Propulsion will be provided by two linked-cam Jolt 402 engines, powered by an enriched uranium reactor with a total output of...

Well, I'll just send you a link to the full technical documentation later. It's really fascinating stuff!

Anyway, I wanted to get in touch because we will no doubt be needing computer systems for the Neptune. Your company seems to have a good reputation, so expect some work orders to come your way as soon as we've finalised our plans.

"PROJECT NEPTUNE: Navigation computer required"
"Hi,

Work is now fully underway on the Neptune Mark I deep-sea submersible! The design process has been challenging, but I'm confident in the final blueprints and construction is going smoothly so far.

My mission is to find the long-lost ruins of the ancient city of Atlantis, which I believe lies not in the Atlantic Ocean - where so many have searched before - but somewhere in the South Pacific!

Yes, it sounds mad - and maybe I am... But soon my claims will be backed up by the discovery of Atlantis itself! Then we'll see who REALLY deserves to be expelled from the Institute of Aquatic Archaeology!

Anyway, your role in all of this will be to build the navigation computer. It doesn't need to be powerful; just a reliable, no-frills workhorse. I am told it will need at least a Pentium G4600 to run the navigation software, but everything else I will leave to your discretion.

One last thing: the work MUST be completed in the next couple of working days. If we miss this deadline we risk setting off during peak fish migration season, which is utterly unacceptable. I won't have them swarming about the Neptune, slapping its hull with their oily fins and staring at me with those mooning, glassy eyes. I tell you, I will not have it!

I have an urgent and difficult request, and I believe you are the best person to handle it.


I have received some upsetting new data on the region of the South Pacific in which I hope to find Atlantis. To confirm or deny its validity, I need to run some complex simulations.


The computer you built for my quarters must be upgraded to be able to run the 'SubSim X' simulation software. According to the manufacturer's website this will mean quite the upgrade, but you've shown me that you're capable and professional, and I have no doubt that you can do this.


I'm willing to pay whatever is necessary to get this done. I DO NOT want to miss the departure window and end up surrounded by thousands of disgusting fish. I have already had to request that a fish tank in my quarters be removed. How that got added to the plans I don't know - I suspect someone is playing a practical joke.

We're a couple of days behind schedule due to technical issues (as you're aware - and many thanks for helping us out there), but so far we seem to have avoided encountering too many of the local fish.

"Hi,


I'll start with the bad news: the Neptune Mark I has hit something of a snag. Well... more of an undersea mountain, really.


We've surfaced for the time being, but the front section of the submersible is taking on water almost as fast as we can pump it back out again. As you might expect, this is slowing down repairs.


Worst of all, our navigation computer has been severely damaged. Thankfully it wasn't crushed by the impact itself, but when the hull was breached the entire system was exposed to seawater. I'm told there was even a... fish deposited inside the case.


In an ideal world, I would simply burn the computer and have a new one built. However, time and money are both in short supply. My private helicopter will deliver the navigation computer to you. Please make any repairs necessary. And ensure there are NO FISH inside - triple check if you have to!


As for the good news, we have made good progress towards where I believe Atlantis to be located. I've no doubt we'll be back in business just as soon as these repairs are completed. I only hope this hold-up doesn't mean we run into the start of the next fish migratory period.

Bad goblins smash up Gradbal's office. They all wearing red cloaks. Say Othrog was their friend.


Redcloaks hurt Gradbal. Make Gradbal tell where shiny is. Now they have Gradbal's shiny.


They want rule Mine 2049. They say Gradbal not supervisor any more. They say Gradbal was corporate puppet used to suppress goblins unsatisfied with unfair working conditions in which they toil for profit they will never see.


Gradbal not know what that means."
"2049@gmcon.com"
"you help us now"
"I Brother Olfik. I leader of Redcloaks. We know you help Gradbal run Mine 2049.


Gradbal gone now. He bad goblin. He kill Brother Othrog. So we put him in cage and Brother Gorkil eat key. Ha ha ha. Gradbal not supervise us any more. Mine 2049 belong to Redcloaks now.


Many nights now we hear chanting voice. It talk to us. It say it powerful spirit. It want us to take over mine.


We follow chanting. It lead to Gradbal. We find big red gem in desk. Not very good hiding place. Gradbal pretty stupid.


Red gem say it called Maelaph, Avatar of Destruction. It ask us to perform ritual of power with big old machines that sleep deep in mine. Not used for many years.


We need computer to run machines. You build it for us. It need big CPU power and red lights.


- Olfik, Leader of Redcloaks"
"2049@gmcon.com"
"computer too hot"
"Maelaph not happy. He say he trapped inside gem by angry sorcerer.

He say he try to burn sorcerer's house but got caught. We say maybe if he not set house on fire he not be stuck inside gem. He say shut up or he curse us.

We use new computer to run big old machine in mine. Maelaph tell us to put gem in machine. He say machine will break gem and free him. He want to rule outside world. He have big plans. We thought he just want rule mine 2049. He say he 'Maelaph, Avatar of Destruction', not 'Maelaph, Supervisor of Stupid Goblin Mine'.

We put gem in machine but gem not break. Machine too old. Now Maelaph very angry. Very scary. I glad he stuck inside gem. Brother Gorkil say he so scared he feel sick but I tell him it just because he eat key to cage where we put Gradbal.

Maelaph say we try again but computer overheat. Maybe too hot and dusty in mines. You try clean computer. Make run good again. Then we free Maelaph.

Then maybe he go away and leave us alone.

"adventurers coming"
"Alarm go off this morning. That mean adventurers coming to raid Mine 2049.


Adventurers like Mine 2049. They come and kill many goblins and take our things. Goblin Mining Confederacy say this 'acceptable loss'. They say it covered by insurance.


Maelaph say if we free him he take care of them. He say he 'wipe the human scourge from the face of the planet and bring fire and destruction to the land'. He say we not try hard enough to break him out of his gem. He say we stupid and lazy.


So Redcloaks took vote and came to decision. This too much hassle for us.


We going to leave Maelaph outside. Then we hide in cage with Gradbal. Wait for peace and quiet again. Brother Gorkil in latrines right now waiting for key to come out.

"2049@gmcon.com"
"gradbal free again!"
"Gradbal was locked in cage for long time. Then big alarms go off. Then all bad Redcloaks get into cage with Gradbal. It very cramped and smelly.


Then bad adventurers come into mines. Gradbal and Redcloaks safe in cage. But they smash everything and take Gradbal's shiny red gem away. That make Redcloaks very happy. Gradbal not know why.


Redcloaks let Gradbal out of cage after humans leave. They say rebellion too hard. It thankless task. Want Gradbal be supervisor again. They sorry for locking Gradbal in cage and eating key. Gradbal sorry for killing Othrog. Goblins all friends again now.


But Mine 2049 out of action for many days. Behind on mining quota. GMC angry. They say they fire everyone if not get back to work right away.


Bad adventurers smash mining computer. We need to make mine work. You fix for Gradbal?

"Gradbal thankful to human for help. Mine 2049 work again now. Big machines smash rock just like old times. GMC happy again and other goblins not wear red cloaks any more.


But Gradbal very excited! Big machine smash rock and Gradbal see something shiny in rubble. It big green gem! Not as pretty as red gem but Gradbal take what he can get.


Green shiny worth big money for sure. Gradbal take to office and hide it in desk. No one find it there.

"Looking for a KINGPIN"
"Hi,

I was given this computer second-hand but I want to upgrade it already so that I won't run into any problems down the line.

I wasn't sure what might be necessary, but my friend said the graphics card is the main thing for games so that's what I've been researching. Originally I was torn between getting a KINGPIN and a AORUS EXTREME EDITION, but after reading a few articles and comparing benchmarks online, I've decided to go for the KINGPIN.

They're both good cards, but I'm just a little bit more confident in the specs on the KINGPIN. Happy to pay up to $1000 for you to fit one. Just don't tell the other guys on the PC Expert Zone forums. I've already got into about half a dozen flamewars over it lol

Oh, and could you clean the computer for me as well? I'm actually allergic to dust so that would be a big help for me.

Thanks,
'Pro' Pat Matei"
"propat@pcexpertzone.com"
"CPU/motherboard upgrade"
"Hi,

Thanks for the new graphics card - I'm really excited about putting it through its paces, and I know I made the right choice.

The only problem is, I didn't realise how underpowered the rest of the machine is. I'm basically learning this stuff as I go!

It looks like the biggest problem right now is my CPU. The guys over at PC Expert Zone recommend the i9-9900K, and I reckon they're right. The benchmarks for that look good, especially with CPU-heavy games like Assassins Creed. Really happy with the numbers I've seen.

The only problem is, from what I've read, that won't fit in my current motherboard. I checked out some hardware reviews and it sounds like the best choice is the Maximus X Apex. Solid hardware, and it gives me some room to upgrade in the future.

Lastly - some new memory. I read that the Trident Z 4500 are the best, so might as well future proof myself and go for some of those.

I'm really getting into this PC building thing! Well, the parts anyway. I'm just not confident enough to try building anything myself. Not yet anyway, lol

Anyway, if you could handle fitting that CPU, motherboard and RAM, that would be great!

"DUST (help please)"
"Hi again,

Sorry to be a pain, but could you clean out my PC? My friend came over a while back to check out the new components and left the dust cover off, but I didn't notice until today.

I'd do it myself, but I'm allergic to dust (I think I mentioned it before?). Don't think I can handle cleaning all that out, so I'm happy to let a professional handle it.

Thanks,
'Pro' Pat Matei"
"propat@pcexpertzone.com"
"Swap my hard drive for an SSD?"
"Hi,

Back again with my PC! I bet you're pretty sick of seeing it lol

Don't worry, I've been trying to learn how to do my own PC building. Did you know there's a simulator you can play to try things out? I'm not ready to do it all myself YET, but I'm feeling more confident already!

Anyway, until then I do need you to do a little job - I've been reading a bunch of articles about the difference a good solid-state drive makes to performance. It's really night and day!

Could you install a really fast m.2 NVME drive for me; any one will do but I heard that the CORSAIR Force Series - MP500 480GB M.2 was the fastest one, so let's go for that.

Thanks,

"Big ask: I want RGB everything!"
"Hi again,

So I know this is going to sound a bit crazy, but I've been looking up some crazy PC builds online (some of the guys on PC Expert Zone have INSANE rigs) and it's made me really want to put some lighting into my case!

I reckon I'm nearly ready to do my own PC building now, but this is a pretty big job so I'd prefer if you could handle it: I want three RGB fans on the front and an RGB CPU cooler. And could you set as many of the lights as you can to rainbow mode? I LOVE rainbow rgb.

Thanks for all your work so far, by the way. It's been really inspirational, and after this I'm going to try and do any other work myself!

"knackered old PC needs a tune-up"
"Hey hey,


My name's Chuck Sharp. If you were around back in the old days of DOS gaming (yes, I'm a dinosaur!), you might remember me as that grumpy git from PC Madness Magazine (1989-1996 R.I.P.).


It was a great gig, but I kinda fell out of touch with the gaming scene after the mag closed down.


Anyway, I stumbled across this PC someone was throwing out the other day, and figured 'What the hell?' Might as well see what games are like these days, right? So I lugged it home and tried to boot it up, but it's in a bit of a state.


I'm no tech-monkey - and I honestly haven't touched the inside of a PC since the 90s - so I've got no idea what's wrong with it, but it keeps turning itself off. Can you sort it out for me?


Thanks mate,

Chuck"
"thatdosguy89@oldgamehub.com"
"I've missed so much!"
"Hey,


Thanks for fixing up that PC for me. I've been having a blast reinstalling all my old favourites from back in the day! I still can't believe what people managed to do with Quake mods.


I know that probably sounds stupid, but I've got so much stuff to catch up on. Have you played Half-Life? I hear it's good.


Chuck"
"thatdosguy89@oldgamehub.com"
"Bought the wrong version of Doom?"
"Hey there,


I've got a bit of an issue.


My nephew came over yesterday and wanted to see my new gaming PC. I thought I'd show him one of my favourite games from back in the day - Doom! It's a real beauty. I gave it 10/10 in PCM #59 (Dec 1993) and I still reckon it's one of the best (and the scariest!) games ever made.


So I went online and grabbed a digital copy(!) of Doom, but the menu screen looks way different to what I was expecting, and it's all running so slow I can't even play the first level.


I did a bit of research and apparently they made a NEW Doom? I guess I bought that by mistake. But I've spent the money now, so I might as well enjoy it. I just need a few upgrades to get it running.


Can you make sure my PC meets the minimum specs? Cheers.


Chuck"

"PC Madness Mag making a comeback?"
"Hey hey,


Just a quick message to say I've been in touch with some of the old PC Madness Magazine crew, and we're going to launch a crowdfunding campaign for a new web version of the mag!


If you want to help out, just search for 'PC Madness Rebooted' and donate whatever you want. We're gonna be bringing the cool factor back to gaming!


Anyway, I'll keep you in the loop. In the meantime I'm gonna get back to playing this new Doom. It's pretty good innit?


Chuck"
"thatdosguy89@oldgamehub.com"
"Need some fancy lighting to make me look good (ha ha)"
"Hey,


The crowdfunding campaign for PC Madness Rebooted is going really well so far - we've already hit 25% of our target! Not bad for a bunch of old farts from the 80s, eh?


Not that the other guys from the mag haven't been doing well. Colin writes for a big gaming news site, 'DigiDave' has a regular column in a national paper, and Peabody even works as a writer at a studio now.


Actually, it's a little bit awkward for me. Not that I've been dossing about since 1996, but I'm still way out of touch with the gaming scene. We're supposed to meet up next week and I don't want them to think I don't know what I'm talking about. Gotta let 'em know that Chuck's still Sharp!


I always thought a sweet custom autoexec.bat was the sign of a real gamer, but I hear these days the thing to do is RGB lighting. Sounds a bit naff to me, but I'm up for it if it'll get me this gig.


So - can you fit some lights to my computer? And let's go for a really cool colour scheme... I'm thinking a cool yellow.


Cheers,

Chuck"

"It's all gone a bit wrong"
"Hey,

You up for another job? No worries if not as I'm sure you're busy, but it is a bit urgent.

I was trying to get Far Cry 5 to run on my PC, but I wasn't super happy with performance (even though it can run the original Quake at like 200 frames per second!) so I thought I'd try out some of this overclocking stuff.

I figured it would be easy, since I know my way around a computer and everything - or at least I thought I did. Bit confused when I opened it up. Like where are all the IDE cables? And how come this motherboard doesn't have AGP?

Anyway, long story short I did... something(??) and now the computer's totally busted. Won't even start up properly.

I need this thing working so I can write a review sample for PC Madness Rebooted! The crowdfunding campaign has slowed down a bit (been stuck at around 68% funded for a few days) but me and the guys reckon a sample review will help show we know what we're doing.

So can you fix it? And while you're at it, can you add whatever it needs to meet the recommended specs for the game?

I don't want to rush you, but I need it done in a couple of days or I'm not gonna get this review written in time.

Cheers mate,
Chuck"
"thatdosguy89@oldgamehub.com"
"PC Madness is back, baby!"
"Woke up this morning to a big surprise: PC Madness Rebooted got fully funded!


Don't know if it was my Far Cry 5 review that nudged it across the finish line (although it was obviously a brilliant and incisive piece of journalism) but whatever it was, it worked!


I've already spoken to Colin, DigiDave, and Peabody about setting up the new site. As soon as the crowdfunding money comes through we're all going to get new gaming PCs - properly decent ones that can run everything at max settings.


... All for professional work purposes, of course.


Anyway, cheers for all the work you've done on my PC lately. It'll still be getting plenty of use at home. I've got about twenty years worth of games to catch up on, and I can't wait to see what else I've missed!

"World of Tanks - The BIG New Update Has Arrived!"
"World of Tanks UPDATE 1.45 NOW AVAILABLE!


World of Tanks is now bigger than ever before! That's right, Update 1.45 (Codename: Thunderhawk) is a complete overhaul of core features based on YOUR feedback.


Release highlights include:


Game world is now 500% bigger

Lots of people have been asking for more space to explore, and we're happy to provide. For a long time we thought this was impossible as it would require investment in a new map, new textures, etc. But then someone found a scale slider and just maxed it out. Enjoy!


All tanks are now 500% bigger

After we increased the size of the game world, things looked pretty silly. All the tanks were tiny compared to everything else, like we were playing with toys. We're not playing with toys - we're REAL MEN driving REAL SIMULATED TANKS. So we scaled the tanks up to match the new world and we're really happy with the result.


All world objects are now 500% bigger

As above, we found that the game didn't look quite right when all the game objects (trees, crates, barrels, etc.) were the wrong scale compared to the world and the tanks. So we scaled them all up too.


Economy overhaul
To reflect the increased scale of the game, many prices have been raised in the in-game item and XP booster store. We realise this may be a cause of concern, but would like to assure you that we are not concerned in the least.


Update 1.45 will be delivered as a 76 GB update file via Treacle CDN.


See you in-game, soldier!

"Seeking old games"
"Hi,


I know this is out of the blue, but I'm a collector of video games and was wondering if you had any old games you might be looking to get rid of?


Working in IT, I thought you might have come across some old boxes or disks and put them aside. They're probably in a back room just gathering dust, but maybe I can take them off your hands.


Trust me, they're not worth anything really. No point even trying to look online for prices - there's just not much of a market for it. But I just love the stupid things, I guess, and I'm happy to pay a small amount to give them a safe home - even if no one else will.


Anyway, if you've got any then let me know. Don't try and research them or anything, just put them all in a box and I'll take the whole lot for, like, £10. That's definitely more than they're going to be worth, but don't worry about that. I'm doing you a favour, really.


So yeah, have a look if you get time. But don't bother looking anything up online. Any prices you see on there will be wrong anyway. People put all kinds of crazy prices sometimes, but they're just lying. You know how people are.

"In Win 303-MSI Dragon Edition
In Win + MSI = Glorious PC

In Win and MSI are globally renowned brands in the PC building community. We each have a similar goal to persistently break the limits, and strive for innovation. In Win and MSI unite for the first time to design the In Win 303-MSI Dragon Edition. The simple aesthetic is slightly altered, but preserved enough to bring forth the stunning Dragon Edition to life.

Spirit of the Dragon Unleashed!
The In Win 303-MSI Dragon Edition is crafted from steel and tempered glass. The distinctively simple front panel is complemented with an RGB I/O strip to balance the overall appearance. Its aesthetic design embodies the spirit of innovation.

Radiant Luminosity
The logo and front I/O strip are highlighted with an RGB LED to provide users with incredible visual experience. Even the 3mm tempered glass side panel will flash a fantastic array of colors!

Accelerated Tool-less Design
In Win has set a standard for being an innovative computer hardware company. Mission accomplished since it has perfected a tool-less design by being able to remove the beautiful 3mm tempered glass side panel by just pressing the handle.

User Friendly Dust Filter
This easily accessible dust filter has an embedded design for quick removal. It’s conveniently located on the bottom, and removing dust has never been easier.

Versatile Cooling Options
The In Win 303-MSI Dragon Edition can accommodate two radiators (top and rear) and three fans at the bottom providing users with a well-cooled rig. The cool air intake from the bottom creates efficient air flow for quick heat dissipation.

In Win's Attention to Detail
The In Win 303-MSI Dragon Edition constructed with 1.2mm SECC, supports 2.5” and 3.5” drive bays, and its separate PSU chamber provides an ideal climate without interfering with the motherboard and graphics card area. The specialized GPU holder can provide extra support to graphics cards. Yet another detail In Win oversees when manufacturing to make PC building much easier."

"RAVEN - RVX01

After completing the evolutionary RAVEN RV05 with 5.25” drive bay design completely removed, the RAVEN team created another forward thinking line of cases with the introduction of the “RAVEN X” subcategory. This line will not only retain the essence of what made the original RAVEN series great with features such as signature aggressive styling and 90 degree rotated layout, but also cater to enthusiasts looking for more exciting designs in an entry-level price point. With the smallest ever footprint for a ATX RAVEN tower case, the RVX01 has remarkably accommodating interior that can easily fit large ATX motherboards up to 12” x 11”, full size graphics card, four 2.5”/3.5” drives, and spaces for up to three radiators. From the factory, the case will come fully equipped with three of SilverStone’s famed Air Penetrator fans for class-leading thermal performance and easy to reach filter for easy maintenance. If you are looking to build an attractive, relatively compact and powerful PC on a budget, the RVX01’s combination of high affordability, top-level cooling ability, and flexible layout will fulfill the task beautifully.

"Temjin Series - TJ11

In 2005, SilverStone created the Temjin TJ07, a tower chassis that was built ahead of its time with unprecedented unibody construction and compartmentalized layout for near limitless liquid cooling configuration. Then in 2006, the Temjin TJ09 was released with beautiful classic styling and advanced see-through air duct designed for cooling generations of powerful graphics cards that was yet to be released. In 2008, SilverStone broke convention and created the first retail computer chassis to implement 90 degree motherboard mounting with the RAVEN RV01, a new design that set benchmarks for balancing air cooling performance and quietness.

Not content to rest on its past achievements, SilverStone engineers aim to set yet another benchmark with the Temjin TJ11 for 2010 and beyond. The TJ11 possess all the greatest features from past SilverStone flagships products along with new designs such as the Air Penetrator fans, making it a superb chassis for cooling and low noise.In addition, there are plenty of ergonomic touches such as quick access filters, hot-swappable hard drive bays, removable motherboard tray, CPU back plate cutout, and optimized cable routing paths to enable easy maintenance/upgrade for always running as efficiently as possible.

For hardcore enthusiasts, the beautifully crafted all aluminum TJ11 is a pleasure to work with as the entire chassis is free of rivets so everything can be taken apart. It also has a bigger lower compartment than the TJ07 to house the largest radiator available such as Hardware Labs Black Ice® SR1 560 (4 x 140mm).
The potential and the flexibility of TJ11 are truly unrivaled. It can be used to build a top of the line gaming PC with its 1000W+ cooling capability on air, build an impressive storage server with its plethora of drive bay options, or build an amazing piece of technology artwork with liquid cooling.

• Compartmentalized layout from Temjin TJ07
• See-through air duct from Temjin TJ09
• 90 degree motherboard mounting from RAVEN RV01
• Includes two Air Penetrator AP181 fans to aid stack cooling
• Room for fitting powerful water cooling equipment
• Motherboard back plate opening behind CPU area for quick cooler assembly
• Supports 11” wide ATX motherboard
• Dual power supply support
• Extra large venting area for 10th expansion slot
• Rivet free construction for maximum serviceability and modding
• All aluminum construction with anodized sand-blasted finish
"
"FT05 (White)

The Fortress FT05 represent SilverStone’s continued dedication in improving and reinventing computer chassis design. Similar to the RAVEN RV05, it no longer has any 5.25” drive bay and utilizes SilverStone’s fame 90 degree rotated design. Previous full ATX SilverStone chassis with 90 degree layout often had to compromise on space efficiency due to fixed length of the motherboard in rotated orientation. So the elimination of 5.25” bays solves this issue naturally and enables FT05 to be not only more balanced in proportion but stunning in its design thanks to its thick wrap-around aluminum exterior. With majority of wasted space eliminated, the FT05 is better optimized for components that affect performance the most such as CPU and GPUs. The result is an expertly-engineered ATX chassis that is just as capable in terms of compute power and heat dissipation as the first RAVEN chassis, the RV01, but in half the size. Equipped with latest revision Air Penetrator fans that include three speed switches and modern touches such as externally removable filters and tool-less panels, the FT05 has everything that PC enthusiasts could wish for in a compact, high performance computer chassis that is not only cool and quiet, but also easy to build and maintain. For those not wanting to constantly step up in chassis size to obtain top-level performance, the Fortress FT05 is perhaps the best and most beautiful solution."

"EK-Supremacy EVO is an evolution of an EK-Supremacy flagship performance water block, introduced in 2012. More than one year worth of round-clock development, CFD analysis, and rigorous testing is now resulting in ultimate performance, unmatched by any other product on the market.

The EK-Supremacy EVO uses the same cooling engine as it's predecessor. The cooling liquid accelerates through jet plate's nozzle and turbulently continues its path through numerous very thin channels, which provide an extreme heat dissipating surface area. Specifically designed and carefully machined base (sometimes referred to as ‘cold plate’) is made from purest materials available on the market and is further polished to absolute mirror finish. This alone greatly improves the cooling performance of EK-Supremacy EVO.

The top is made from CNC machined acrylic glass while the insert is made from injection molded transparent MABS polymer.

This CPU block replaces the CPU cooler in your system and allows your custom watercooling loop to cool the processor.

It fits any processor socket apart from Threadripper."

"EK-Supremacy EVO is an evolution of an EK-Supremacy flagship performance water block, introduced in 2012. More than one year worth of round-clock development, CFD analysis, and rigorous testing is now resulting in ultimate performance, unmatched by any other product on the market.



The EK-Supremacy EVO uses the same cooling engine as it's predecessor. The cooling liquid accelerates through jet plate's nozzle and turbulently continues its path through numerous very thin channels, which provide an extreme heat dissipating surface area. Specifically designed and carefully machined base (sometimes referred to as ‘cold plate’) is made from purest materials available on the market and is further polished to absolute mirror finish. This alone greatly improves the cooling performance of EK-Supremacy EVO.



The top is made from CNC machined acrylic glass while the insert is made from injection molded transparent MABS polymer.

"FT05 (Black)

The Fortress FT05 represent SilverStone’s continued dedication in improving and reinventing computer chassis design. Similar to the RAVEN RV05, it no longer has any 5.25” drive bay and utilizes SilverStone’s fame 90 degree rotated design. Previous full ATX SilverStone chassis with 90 degree layout often had to compromise on space efficiency due to fixed length of the motherboard in rotated orientation. So the elimination of 5.25” bays solves this issue naturally and enables FT05 to be not only more balanced in proportion but stunning in its design thanks to its thick wrap-around aluminum exterior. With majority of wasted space eliminated, the FT05 is better optimized for components that affect performance the most such as CPU and GPUs. The result is an expertly-engineered ATX chassis that is just as capable in terms of compute power and heat dissipation as the first RAVEN chassis, the RV01, but in half the size. Equipped with latest revision Air Penetrator fans that include three speed switches and modern touches such as externally removable filters and tool-less panels, the FT05 has everything that PC enthusiasts could wish for in a compact, high performance computer chassis that is not only cool and quiet, but also easy to build and maintain. For those not wanting to constantly step up in chassis size to obtain top-level performance, the Fortress FT05 is perhaps the best and most beautiful solution."

Decisively Improved
The successor of the Freezer 11 series convinces all along the line with regards to noise level, cooling capacity, mounting versatility and transport-proofness. As semi passive cooler, the Freezer 12 also works extremely efficiently as the fan only starts up at a PWM signal with 40 % pulse width. 
The contact surface of the Freezer 12 direct-touch heatpipes does not cover the full protection cap of the CPU, but, more importantly, covers the whole processor DIE of the various compatible CPU. This leads to ideal cooling performance.

Semi Passive Cooling
With semi passive operation the Freezer 12 provides again a special feature. A sophisticated fan controller that was developed by German engineers allows passive cooling of the CPU during simple applications such as surfing and creating documents. The 92 mm fan only starts up at a PWM signal with 40 % pulse width. This saves energy, extends the service life and makes the cooler at low load completely silent.

SilverStone created the Lucid series in an attempt to combine SilverStone’s traditionally excellent engineering quality with transparent or “lucid” aesthetics of glass-based exterior. LD01, as the first Lucid series chassis, achieves this objective in splendid fashion. The striking exterior is covered in tempered glass flanked by functional stainless steel bands that not only adds a touch of premium feel but also protect the glass and simplify installation. With inverted motherboard tray design taken from the Temjin TJ08-E, one of the best Micro-ATX cases ever released, graphics or expansion cards installed into the LD01 can intake fresh air from above the chassis for vastly superior cooling compared with traditional layout that has the PSU & drive cage shroud limiting airflow. Another benefit of the inverted layout is that graphics card supporter will make contact only with graphics card's backside, thus eliminate potential interference with graphics card fans. Other notable features the LD01 has include front USB Type-C connector, quick access dust filter, smart backside cable routing, highly flexible space for installing all popular core components, and support for multiple cooling configurations. There are five total 120 / 140mm fan slots around the case with maximum radiator support at front, top, and rear. For those looking for a compact, beautiful glass design in Micro-ATX form factor without compromises, the LD01 is the clear and lucid choice."

"SX500-G

After pioneering full featured, high performance SFX power supplies in 2012, SilverStone has continued refining the segment it has created. The SX500-G and SX650-G are yet another evolutionary step toward perfecting this small form factor power supply category. They are more powerful without growing in size to achieve class-leading power density levels of 633W per liter for the SX500-G and 818W per liter for the SX650-G. This increase in power density was achieved through more advanced engineering and component selection so rather than added noise as is the norm for upping wattage output in power supplies, the SX500-G and SX650-G are quieter than their less powerful predecessors. Their noise signature was further lowered thanks to the use of 92mm fans versus 80mm on previous models. For connectivity, the SX500-G and SX650-G are equipped with more connectors so they can be used in wider variety of system configurations. SilverStone’s famed short, flexible flat cables will of course be part of the package as well (a longer standard length cable set, the PP05-L is available for purchase separately). For those looking for the best bang for the buck in high performance SFX power supplies, the SX500-G and SX650-G will not disappoint."

They are more powerful without growing in size to achieve class-leading power density levels of 633W per liter for the SX500-G and 818W per liter for the SX650-G. This increase in power density was achieved through more advanced engineering and component selection so rather than added noise as is the norm for upping wattage output in power supplies, the SX500-G and SX650-G are quieter than their less powerful predecessors. Their noise signature was further lowered thanks to the use of 92mm fans versus 80mm on previous models. For connectivity, the SX500-G and SX650-G are equipped with more connectors so they can be used in wider variety of system configurations. SilverStone’s famed short, flexible flat cables will of course be part of the package as well (a longer standard length cable set, the PP05-L is available for purchase separately). For those looking for the best bang for the buck in high performance SFX power supplies, the SX500-G and SX650-G will not disappoint."

"I'm hoping it'll be able to benchmark around [BENCHMARK_SCORE]."
"I saw a PC build online that benchmarked [BENCHMARK_SCORE]!! Can you hit that?"
"This part is important: I need it to benchmark at LEAST [BENCHMARK_SCORE]."
"So I need it to get about [BENCHMARK_SCORE] in benchmarks, if possible."

"Do you think you can do it for less than [SPEND_LESS_THAN]?"
"I've saved up for a while - I've got [SPEND_LESS_THAN] to spend on this."
"I can spend about [SPEND_LESS_THAN]."
"My budget is about [SPEND_LESS_THAN]. Hope that's okay."

"I'm pretty sure I saw sparks or fire or something! Won't turn on now."
"I keep getting errors when I try to turn the pc on."
"None of the fans are working, and neither is the hard drive. Weird, right?"
"When I turn it on, the fans don't turn and then I get an overheating error."

"Is it possible the [REPLACE_PART] has failed?"
"It’s probably the [REPLACE_PART]."
"I’ve got no idea what might have happened."
"Any ideas?"
"Did I break something?"
"I'd fix it myself, but I'm way too busy."
"Why do computers always go wrong for me?"
"My mate says it's probably the [REPLACE_PART]."
"I don't know what's happening - you're the expert!"
"I suspect the [REPLACE_PART] is on its way out."
"I think my [REPLACE_PART] is dying."
"The [REPLACE_PART] must have failed."
"It's got to be the [REPLACE_PART], right?"
"I'm pretty sure the [REPLACE_PART] is acting up."
"Can you try and work out what's wrong?"
"I just want my computer to work!"
"Has the CPU broken or something?"
"Is it a problem with the RAM?"
"I bought this PC second-hand, so it could be anything."
"This rig used to belong to my mate, so I don't even know what's inside."

"Is the [REPLACE_PART] broken?"
"I think the [REPLACE_PART] is broken."
"I reckon it's because of the [REPLACE_PART]."
"Did my [REPLACE_PART] die? I only got it a few months ago!"
"The warranty for the [REPLACE_PART] just expired, so it's probably that lol"
"The [REPLACE_PART]. It's gotta be, right?"
"I'm 90% sure it's the [REPLACE_PART]."
"Please fix my [REPLACE_PART]!"
"Can you fix the [REPLACE_PART]?"
"Have you got any ideas what might be wrong?"
"I'm at a loss, honestly."
"What do you think? Is it the [REPLACE_PART]?"
"My horoscope totally warned me about this."
"I have the worst luck :("
"I wish I knew what was wrong!"
"Sorry, I can't tell you any more than that."

"My son is always going on about 3DMark, what is that?"
"If you can, I'd love some [CABLES] cables in there."
"It looks a bit bland in there, some [CABLES] cables might make it look nicer."
"I was on PC Bay the other day and saw some awesome [CABLES] cables."
"Do you like cable modding? I saw some great [CABLES] ones the other day."

"I heard that the optimum case temperature for a PC is [CASE_TEMP] or below."
"I read in a magazine a PC should always be cooler than [CASE_TEMP]."
"An astrologist said my lucky case temperature is [CASE_TEMP] or below."
"Case temps above [CASE_TEMP] are just plain cruel, in my opinion."
"That Tim guy worked on it last, and it's always run hot since."
"Tim fixed it last time."

"and they cleaned it up really nicely."
"but it's still pretty filthy."
"but it came back dusty as anything!"
"but it belched out dust when I turned the PC back on."
"but I would've hoped they'd have cleaned it."
"but it's a shame they left it so dirty."
"and I can tell they tested it pretty well."
"and it benchmarked really well."
"and they took the time to benchmark it too."
"and they were thorough, giving it a benchmark before returning it."
"and they benchmarked it too!"
"but I don't think they really checked it before sending it back."
"but the PC crashed when I benchmarked it."
"but I wish they had benchmarked it to make sure."
"but why didn't they benchmark it? Cowboys!"
"but there was no sign they'd checked it under any kind of load."
"and they gave me lovely new [CABLES] cables!"
"and they put in some new cables for me!"

"and it boots up, no problems here!"
"and it boots, which is more than can be said for some other PC repair people."
"and it loads up - bonus!"
"but it still crashes with some tasks, did they stress-test it? 1 star."
"but I have to give 1 star because it's just not stable - it crashes as soon as I run a benchmark!"
"but I can tell they didn't stress test it - it boots but if you run a benchmark it just crashes. 1 star."
"but when I ran a heavy program the thing crashed so it's clear they didn't stress test it - not happy :("
"but I just wish they actually run a heavy program to check it worked under load. 1 star."
"and it's running cooler than ever."
"and the temps are great - thank you!"
"and they even managed to get it to run cooler."
"and they clearly paid attention to the cooling, it's running nicely now."
"and it's nice to see they made it run cooler."
"but it still runs hot at times :("
"but the temps are not great - what did they do?"
"but it's a bit hot, shouldn't they look at that?"
"but it's come back hot and the fans are always running full whack."
"but I just wish they'd looked at the thermals."
"and it seems they used thermal paste. That wasn't always the case!"
"and this time the cpu was properly installed, things are looking up!"
"and it looks like Tim has learned to use thermal paste!"
"and the cpu temp is great."
"and respect to the dot method of thermal paste application."
"but there's no thermal paste - total amateurs! 1 star."
"but they haven't applied thermal paste - 1 star."
"but I'd give them 0 stars if I could - there's no thermal paste on it!"
"but AGAIN they haven't applied thermal paste so I wont be coming here again."
"but I'm livid because they forgot the thermal paste. 1 STAR!"
"and they used brand new parts which is always a good sign."
"and they used nice shiny new parts."
"and they didn't try to fob me off with second hand parts, which is nice."
"and it's all new parts, top job!"
"and they used all new parts - got to love those warranties!"
"but I think some of these parts aren't new."
"but they scrimped and used old parts."
"but I can see some of those parts aren't new, I hope I didn't pay full price."
"but I would have preferred they use all new parts."
"but I worry that the used parts they've installed might not last as long."
"but as soon as I use it properly it thermal throttles. 1 star."
"but when playing games I get a warning about thermal throttling. 1 star."
"but it keeps thermal throttling, didn't they check this? 1 star."
"but there's constant thermal throttling so I'm giving them 1 star."

"Welcome to PC Building Simulator Free Build Mode"
"In this mode you can build PCs using all the current parts included in the game. All parts can be found in your inventory which can be accessed via the shelving or by pressing 'I'. We recommend you play career mode first to get a feel for the controls."
"Welcome to PC Building Simulator"
"To begin, go to your PC (by the doorway) and open the email program on the desktop - you've got mail!"
"Things Take Time"
"Customer's PCs will take a day to arrive, so end the current day by going to the workshop door."
"Get To Work"
"The customer's PC is here, pick it up with 'Right Mouse Button' and take it to your workbench to fix it."
"Continue"
"Job Complete!"
"You've completed your first job, well done!

Come back tomorrow to see if there are some more jobs to do."
"Plug the PC in"
"For this job you need to run a virus scan.

Press '3' or the 'Cable' button and plug the Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse and Power into the back of the PC."
"Insert USB Drive"
"Now you need to put your USB Drive into the back of the PC so you can install the Virus Scanner. 

Press '1' or the 'Install' button to go into your inventory and select the USB Drive - it plugs into the USB slot on the back of the PC."
"Insert USB Drive"
"First of all, you need to install the new overclocking app (OCCT) in the client PC. "
"Power on the PC"
"Now press 'P' or the 'Power' button to turn the PC on. Click on the Monitor to use the Operating System (OS) of the machine."
"Install the Virus Scanner"
"Welcome to Omega OS, the operating system of choice!

Click on Add/Remove Programs to install the Virus Scanner and don't forget to restart the PC after it has installed!"
"Collect your Reward"
"Great! Now you just need to collect your pay - go to your email and hit 'Collect'."
"Buy your Components"
"Go to the shop on your PC to buy the components you need and you can have them delivered at the same time as the client's PC."
"Time your Delivery"
"Use the delivery options to choose when best to receive your components. Often it's better to pay for faster delivery than wait days to receive things."
"Ending the Day"
"Here you can end your day and advance to tomorrow.

Right now you have no active jobs but normally it's worth checking you've ordered any parts you need for tomorrow before going home!"
"Your Parts are Here"
"Your new parts have arrived, click on the boxes to put them in your inventory."
"Building a Whole PC"
"This job requires you to build an entire PC from scratch.

You will need to buy all the parts and an empty case from the shop."
"Assigning a PC Build to a Job"
"For a Build Job, a yellow label is placed on the whiteboard in the office.

Pick up the yellow label and attach it to a workbench, then build a PC on that workbench to complete the job."
"Cleaning a PC"
"Press the 'Install' button and get the Compressed Air from your Tools. You then click on the PC's components to blow away the dust until it has all been removed."
"Fit for Purpose"
"This job requires you to use the 'Will it Run' program that can be purchased from the shop. Install it on a PC to check what specs are required for the game and if that PC will run it."
"Diagnose What's Wrong"
"This mission requires you to figure out what's wrong with the PC before being able to order parts."
"Diagnose What's Wrong"
"Try turning the power on and see what happens (often the BIOS will give you a clue to what's wrong) - if nothing happens then it could be a broken PSU. If that doesn't help, work your way through the components until you find the broken ones."
"All Done!"
"You have removed all the viruses and the PC is ready to be returned to the client. Pick the PC up with 'Right Mouse Button' and place it in the Delivery Area."
"Almost There"
